Zomato close project using react js, redux toolkit and tailwind css. 

--> in this Zomato clone I use many react js library such as 
1 react-router for navigation.
2 react-slick for slider.
3 redux-toolkit for state management.

4 react-icon for add icon on page
5 react-hot-toast for message show after action performed

--> this project are completely responsive website using tailwind css.

--> one feature I add in Zomato clone is add to cart ðŸ›’. not in original Zomato website because order in Zomato only in Zomato app.

--> the all data like dining-out and delivery,foods and other are create in js file of JSON structure.

this project learn many things like how to manage all data, how to transfer data from one component to another and etc.
